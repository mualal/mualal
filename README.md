## Brief introduction
Hello! My name is Alexander Muravtsev and I am currently a graduate student in Mechanics and Mathematical Modeling for Oil and Gas Industry.

My research interests include mathematical modeling of physics processes, numerical algorithms for complex PDE systems, computer vision, and high performance computing.
I'm also interested in using Machine Learning techniques to optimization problems.

Besides coding, I also enjoy presenting and demoing Python.
